\title{gibbs.samp}
\usage{
gibbs.samp(x, y, N, w, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of masses (unique from mass/retention time pairs).}

\item{y}{a vector of candidate compounds for each mass.}

\item{N}{number of iterations to sample.}

\item{w}{matrix of compound connections.}

\item{p}{matrix of likelihood probabilities.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices with attribution indexes and probabilities.
}
\description{
Call a C++ function that runs a Gibbs Sampler algorithm  
to sample from the distribution of metabolite to compound attribution
with the previous assumption that the connected combination of
attributions makes more sense.
}
\examples{
# Not to run 
# tmp <- which(w==1, arr.ind=TRUE)
# w_sparse <- sparseMatrix(i = tmp[,1], j = tmp[,2],x = rep(1, nrow(tmp)), dims = c(C,C))
 # x <- 1:ncol(wl$wm)
 # y <- 1:nrow(wl$wm)
 # system.time(conn <- gibbs.samp(x, y, 5000 , w_sparse, p))
